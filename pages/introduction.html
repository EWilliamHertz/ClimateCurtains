                        <h2>The Problem with Windows</h2>
                        <p>Windows are essential for light and aesthetics but are often the weakest link in energy efficiency, with insulation values just a tenth of walls. The problem with heating buildings is that a tremendous amount of heat disappears through the windows.</p>
                        <p>With the insulation value often to just a tenth of those of walls, windows are essentially holes in walls that leak energy. This leads to significant heat loss, higher energy bills, and increased carbon footprint.</p>
                        <p>In an average house, 30-50% of heating costs are due to heat loss through windows, which amounts to approximately a loss of 5000 kWh a year. In public and commercial buildings such as schools, offices, and other industrial buildings, the percentage of heat loss through windows is even greater, especially if there is a lot of glass in the structure.</p>

                        <h2>Most Buildings Stand Empty</h2>
                        <p>While windows account for about a third of the energy loss for heating, offices and school buildings are not in use 60-75% of the time. This means that if the windows in a vacant building are covered with highly-insulating curtains, a lot of energy and money will be saved.</p>
                        <p>This presents a significant opportunity for energy conservation. By implementing ClimateCurtains in buildings during periods of vacancy, we can dramatically reduce energy waste and costs.</p>
                        <p>Our solution is particularly effective for commercial and public buildings with large window areas and predictable periods of non-use, such as nights, weekends, and holidays.</p>

                        <h2>A New Generation of Climate-Smart Curtains</h2>
                        <p>ClimateCurtains is the solution. Our patented product retains the heat energy inside the building effectively. Climate Curtains is a Swedish company based in Vänersborg, dedicated to sustainable innovation.</p>
                        <p>Our patented roller blinds are designed to reduce heat loss, provide light control, and suit any building—from modern homes to heritage-listed properties. Save energy, lower costs, and embrace sustainability without compromising style.</p>
                        <p>Independent testing in collaboration with Chalmers University and supported by the Swedish Energy Agency has proven that our curtains can save at least 15% of heating energy in a typical Swedish family home, with even greater savings in harsher climates or buildings with larger, less-insulated windows.</p>
